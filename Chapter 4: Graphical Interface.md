# Chapter 4: Graphical Interface

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Manage graphical interface sessions.
* Perform basic operations using the graphical interface.
* Change the graphical desktop to suit your needs.


You can use either a Command Line Interface **(CLI)** or a Graphical User Interface **(GUI)** when using Linux. To work at the CLI, you have to remember which programs and commands are used to perform tasks, and how to quickly and accurately obtain more information about their use and options. On the other hand, using the GUI is often quick and easy. It allows you to interact with your system through graphical icons and screens. For repetitive tasks, the CLI is often more efficient, while the GUI is easier to navigate if you do not remember all the details or do something only rarely. 

We will learn how to manage sessions using the GUI for the three Linux distribution families that we cover the most in this course: Red Hat (CentOS, Fedora), SUSE (openSUSE), and Debian (Ubuntu, Mint). Since we are using the GNOME-based variant of openSUSE rather than the KDE-based one, all are actually quite similar. If you are using KDE (or other Linux desktops such as XFCE), your experience will vary somewhat from what is shown, but not in any intrinsically difficult way, as user interfaces have converged to certain well-known behaviors on modern operating systems. In subsequent sections of this course we will concentrate in great detail on the command line interface, which is pretty much the same on all distributions.



### X Window System


Generally, in a Linux desktop system, the X Window System is loaded as one of the final steps in the boot process.  It is often just called X.

A service called the Display Manager keeps track of the displays being provided and loads the X server (so-called, because it provides graphical services to applications, sometimes called X clients). The display manager also handles graphical logins and starts the appropriate desktop environment after a user logs in.

X is rather old software; it dates back to the mid 1980s and, as such, has certain deficiencies on modern systems (for example, with security), as it has been stretched rather far from its original purposes. A newer system, known as Wayland, is gradually superseding it and is the default display system for Fedora, RHEL 8, and other recent distributions. For the most part, it looks just like X to the user, although under the hood it is quite different.

If the display manager is not started by default in the default runlevel, you can start the graphical desktop different way, after logging on to a text-mode console, by running **startx** from the command line. Or, you can start the display manager **(gdm, lightdm, kdm, xdm, etc.)** manually from the command line. This differs from running startx as the display managers will project a sign in screen. We discuss them next.


### GUI Startup

When you install a desktop environment, the X display manager starts at the end of the boot process. It is responsible for starting the graphics system, logging in the user, and starting the user’s desktop environment. You can often select from a choice of desktop environments when logging in to the system.
The default display manager for GNOME is called gdm. Other popular display managers include lightdm (used on Ubuntu before version 18.04 LTS) and kdm (associated with KDE).
