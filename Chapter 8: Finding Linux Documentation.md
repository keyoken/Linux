# Chapter 8: Finding Linux Documentation

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:

* Use different sources of documentation.
* Use the man pages.
* Access the GNU info System.
* Use the help command and --help option.
* Use other documentation sources.


### Linux Documentation Sources

Whether you are an inexperienced user or a veteran, you will not always know (or remember) the proper use of various Linux programs and utilities: what is the command to type, what options does it take, etc. You will need to consult help documentation regularly. Because Linux-based systems draw from a large variety of sources, there are numerous reservoirs of documentation and ways of getting help. Distributors consolidate this material and present it in a comprehensive and easy-to-use manner.

Important Linux documentation sources include:
* The man pages (short for manual pages)
* GNU Info
* The help command and --help option
* Other documentation sources, e.g. Gentoo Handbook or Ubuntu Documentation.


### The man pages

The man pages are the most often-used source of Linux documentation. They provide in-depth documentation about many programs and utilities, as well as other topics, including configuration files, and programming APIs for system calls, library routines, and the kernel. They are present on all Linux distributions and are always at your fingertips.

The man pages infrastructure was first introduced in the early UNIX versions, at the beginning of 1970s. The name man is just an abbreviation for manual.

Typing man with a topic name as an argument retrieves the information stored in the topic's man pages.

***man*** pages are often converted to other formats, such as PDF documents and web pages. To learn more, take a look at Linux man pages online. Many web pages have a graphical interface for help items, which may include man pages.
