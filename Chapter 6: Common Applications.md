### Email Applications

Email applications allow for sending, receiving, and reading messages over the Internet. Linux systems offer a wide number of email clients, both graphical and text-based. In addition, many users simply use their browsers to access their email accounts.
Most email clients use the Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) or the older Post Office Protocol (POP) to access emails stored on a remote mail server. Most email applications also display HTML (HyperText Markup Language) formatted emails that display objects, such as pictures and hyperlinks. The features of advanced email applications include the ability of importing address books/contact lists, configuration information, and emails from other email applications.
Linux supports the following types of email applications:

* Graphical email clients, such as Thunderbird, Evolution, and Claws Mail
* Text mode email clients, such as Mutt and mail
* All web browser-based clients, such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail, and Office 365.
