#Three Important Pieces of Context

Please keep in mind the following:

##Things change in Linux##

<p>No matter how hard we have worked to stay current, Linux is constantly evolving, both at the technical level (including kernel features) and at the distribution and interface level. So, please keep in mind we have tried to be as up-to-date as possible at the time this course was released, but there may be changes and new features we have not discussed. This is unavoidable.

We have repeated some things in the class material

It is just about impossible in a course this comprehensive to never revisit topics that have previously been covered, and short reviews are helpful so you do not have to go scouring through earlier sections to jog your memory. This is particularly true with system configuration items, like how to use sudo to gain temporary root privileges in as safe a manner as possible. We know we have done this and, at least in most cases, it is by design, not by accident.


We have tried to avoid holy wars

There are many areas where there are strong preference disagreements in the Linux (and wider open source) community. Examples include the best editor: emacs vs. vi; the best graphical desktop: GNOME vs. KDE, etc. Usually, we have chosen (when necessary) a particular alternative to emphasize just to keep things clean. For example, we talk much more about GNOME than KDE simply because it has a bigger user base, not because we are taking a position as to which is superior.
